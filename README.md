# crypto-api
Cryptocurrency REST and websocket API with support for multiple exchanges.

**NOTE**: At the moment, this is primarily a personal project and I do not make any guarantees that it will work on your system.
If you are planning on trading anything beyond very low amounts (>$100), please use the amazing [CCXT](github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library.
If you want websocket support with CCXT, you will need to pay for [CCXT Pro](ccxt.pro). 
This project is actually built on the basic CCXT library.
